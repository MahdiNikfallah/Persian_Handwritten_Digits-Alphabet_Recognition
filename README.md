# Persian_Handwritten_Digits-Letters_Recognition
## About this project
The purpose of this project is to extract and recognize Persian Handwritten Digits/Alphabet from a form.
this project has been developed as final project of Foundations of Computer Vision Course.

the accuracy of this work for digit recognition is about 98% and for letter recognition is about 96%.

##how to use:
the input is a form like the ones below (photo can be taken from any angle).

the process of extraction and prediction will begin by running the script "letter_digit_prediction" and the result will be shown in the form of plot and the predicted text.

there are three other scripts which are responsible for extracting the database form "preprocess_3.py" and training, testing and validating "Digits_neural.ipynb , Letters_neural.ipynb".

## Datasets
nearly 2,000 data for each letter

nearly 1,500 data for each digit

totally about 80,000 handwritten letters and digits from more than 300 different people.

## Dependencies

numpy (1.16.4)

tensorflow (1.14.0)

keras (2.2.4)

opencv (3.4)

## Digit Recognition Cnn Architecture
